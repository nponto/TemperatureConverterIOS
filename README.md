## How to Use

Temperature Converter uses an on-screen slider, enabling the user to enter a temperature value. The app will update the Celcius and Fahrenheit calculations of this slider value in real-time.

## App Store Publication

This app is not currently published on the App Store. I do not currently have plans to do so due to the fees involved in publishing an iOS App, so you'll need to download the files and use them in XCode.
